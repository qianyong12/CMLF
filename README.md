# CMLF
Compact Machine Learning Framework

### Introduction
This is a compact machine learning framework written in C++. The goal of writing it is that I want to create a very simply ML framework which consists no complex models. The program can be run in any machine if you have installed gcc. No more packages, models, and other dependent files. Luckily, I made it!

The current version is 1.0

The CMLF can be used in any MLP network. You can configure the network structure by yourself.

In the following version, CNN and other machine laerning framework will be supported.

### Example
Two examples provided in the src can be used to test the network.

- test_main.cpp The classification of XOR gate is done, which is thought to be the easiest non-linear problem.
- infra_main.cpp The classification of infrared images. The data in the folder "data" are mean and variance got from the images.

### Bugs
- You can not print extra "enter" in the config file. Otherwise, the program may stop working

### No time to write more detail information. Sorry~
